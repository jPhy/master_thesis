Notes to write the Thesis
#########################

o Title should not exceed one line, otherwise automatic formatting in table of contents fails.

Including Graphics
------------------

o Use format .svg (scalable vector graphics) if vector graphics possible, .png otherwise. Note that .pdf cannot be treated by LibreOffice.

o matplotlib figures: Save as .svg in matplotlib. Then open with Inkscape and make sure that page properties are set to produce a "Portrait" oriented page. Print to .svg file.
